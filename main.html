	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science
		that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the
		amount of time it takes to run as a function of the input size.
		It helps us analyze how an algorithm's performance scales with
		larger inputs. An algorithm is considered efficient if its time
		complexity grows slowly as the input size increases, allowing it to 
		handle larger problems without a significant
		increase in execution time.</p>
    
    <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory
		space an algorithm requires to solve a problem as a function of the 
		input size. It is crucial to consider the space complexity of an
		algorithm, especially in memory-constrained environments. 
		One common way to represent space complexity
		is using the notation 'O(n)', where 'n' represents the size of 
		the input. In other words, the space complexity indicates how the
		memory usage grows as the input size increases.
		<b>Space Complexity</b> analysis helps us design algorithms that 
		minimize memory usage while efficiently solving problems.</p>
